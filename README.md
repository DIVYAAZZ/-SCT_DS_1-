##📊 Task 01 – Visualizing India's Age-Wise Population Distribution (2022)
##🔍 Objective
The goal of this task is to create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of India's population by age group. This kind of visualization helps us understand how the population is spread across different age categories, which is essential for decision-making in policy, economy, education, and healthcare.

##📈 Description
Using publicly available data from the UN World Population Prospects (2022), the population has been categorized into three broad age groups:

Age Group	Population (in millions)	Percentage
0–20 Years	512 Mn	36.1%
21–64 Years	807 Mn	57.0%
65+ Years	98 Mn	6.9%

A bar chart was created using matplotlib in Python to visually represent this distribution. Each bar is color-coded to differentiate the age groups:

🟨 Yellow for 0–20 years

🟦 Blue for 21–64 years

🟪 Magenta for 65+ years

The chart also includes data labels above each bar to indicate the exact population size.
